            out of business." <br />- Bill Gates

        <div class="reason reason-1">
          <h3>
            <span class="text-secondary"
              >1. Having your own website will attract new customers and make
              you more money.</span
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            81% of people research a business or service online before making a
            decision. Without a website you're missing out on capturing a big
            share of the market.
          </p>

        <div class="reason reason-2">
          <h3>
            <span class="text-secondary"
              >2. A website adds instant professionalism to your business.</span
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most people are skeptical when dealing with a new business, having a
            good website instantly boosts your credibility as a legitimate
            business.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="reason reason-3">
          <h3>
            <span class="text-secondary"
              >3. Websites can save you time and money.
            </span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Time is money, right? Well you're in luck, a website can easily save
            you both time and money. Throughout your business day you're trading
            emails, taking calls, or a multitude of other things - communicating
            with future customers takes time. Having your own website can save a
            TON of time by providing answers to many questions customers may
            have. As a bonus, a website is a legitimate business expense and a
            tax write off.
